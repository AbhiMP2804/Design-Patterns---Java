/*
 * Builder Design Pattern : 

While creating object when object contain many attributes there are many problems exists :

1. We have to pass many arguments to create object
2. some parameters might be optional
3. Factory class takes all responsibility for creating object, if the object is heavy then all complexity is the part of factory class.

Used for creating immutable objects and helpw to create objects step by tep with not need of remembering all the constraints in sequence as well as optional constraints can be skipped or used.

This is exactly what the **Builder Pattern** does â€” it lets you **create an object step by step**, setting only the values you care about, instead of writing a long constructor like:

ðŸ”‘ What is **Method Chaining**?

Method chaining is when you call **multiple methods in a single line** by having each method return the current object (`this`).

- **Method chaining** = returning `this` so you can call the next method in the same line.
- **Advantages** = readability, fluency, less repetition, cleaner code.
- **Here** = it makes the `Builder Pattern` work in a nice, step-by-step style.
